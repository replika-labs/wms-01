# Progress History Implementation - Enhanced with ProductProgressReport & ProductProgressPhoto

## Overview

This implementation enhances the progress history feature in the order management detail page by properly utilizing the `ProductProgressReport` and `ProductProgressPhoto` tables from the Prisma schema.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Progress Report Controller (`server/controllers/progressReportController.js`)

- **Enhanced data fetching**: Uses both `ProgressReport` and `ProductProgressReport` tables
- **Photo integration**: Combines legacy photos with new `ProductProgressPhoto` entries
- **Per-product tracking**: Shows detailed progress for each product in an order
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintains support for legacy progress reports

### 2. Updated Order Link Controller (`server/controllers/orderLinkController.js`)

- **Enhanced progress submission**: Creates both `ProgressReport` and `ProductProgressReport` entries
- **Photo storage**: Saves photos to `ProductProgressPhoto` table with proper metadata
- **Legacy support**: Updates legacy progress submission to use new table structure
- **Transaction safety**: Uses Prisma transactions for data consistency

### 3. Updated Progress Report Routes (`server/routes/progressReportRoutes.js`)

- **Enabled endpoints**: Replaced disabled migration endpoints with working implementations
- **New photo endpoint**: Added `/api/progress-reports/:orderId/photos` for photo gallery
- **Proper authentication**: Maintains security with protect middleware

### 4. Enhanced Frontend Display (`client/app/dashboard/orders-management/[id]/page.js`)

- **Rich progress history**: Shows per-product progress details
- **Photo gallery**: Displays progress photos in a responsive grid
- **Enhanced metadata**: Shows completion dates, quality notes, challenges
- **Visual indicators**: Progress badges, completion status, photo counts

### 5. File Upload Utility (`server/utils/fileUpload.js`)

- **Multer configuration**: Handles image uploads with validation
- **File organization**: Stores photos in `/uploads/progress-photos/`
- **Security**: File type validation and size limits
- **Helper functions**: URL generation and file management

## Database Schema Utilization

### ProductProgressReport Table

```sql
- progressReportId: Links to main ProgressReport
- productId: Specific product being worked on
- orderProductId: Links to OrderProduct for quantity tracking
- itemsCompleted: Number of pieces completed for this product
- itemsTarget: Target quantity for this product
- status: 'in_progress' | 'completed'
- notes: Quality notes, challenges, estimated completion
- completionDate: When product was completed
```

### ProductProgressPhoto Table

```sql
- productProgressReportId: Links to ProductProgressReport
- photoPath: File path to the uploaded photo
- thumbnailPath: Optional thumbnail path
- description: Photo caption/description
- uploadDate: When photo was uploaded
- fileSize: File size in bytes
- mimeType: Image MIME type
- isActive: Soft delete flag
```

## Key Features

### 1. Per-Product Progress Tracking

- Each product in an order can have individual progress updates
- Shows completed vs target quantities per product
- Tracks quality scores, work hours, material usage
- Individual completion dates and status

### 2. Enhanced Photo Management

- Photos are stored in dedicated `ProductProgressPhoto` table
- Supports multiple photos per progress update
- Shows photo thumbnails in timeline
- Photo metadata (size, type, upload date)
- Backward compatibility with legacy photo storage

### 3. Rich Timeline Display

- Shows both legacy and new progress reports
- Per-product completion details
- Photo gallery with descriptions
- Progress percentages and completion status
- Tailor name and timestamp information

### 4. Data Consistency

- Uses Prisma transactions for atomic operations
- Maintains relationships between tables
- Proper error handling and rollback
- Backward compatibility with existing data

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/progress-reports?orderId=:id`

Returns enhanced progress reports with:

- Main progress report data
- Per-product progress details
- Associated photos from ProductProgressPhoto
- Tailor/user information
- Timeline metadata

### POST `/api/progress-reports`

Creates legacy-style progress reports with:

- Automatic ProductProgressReport creation
- Photo storage in ProductProgressPhoto table
- Order completion tracking
- Stock updates when completed

### GET `/api/progress-reports/:orderId/photos`

Returns all photos for an order with:

- Product-specific photo categorization
- Upload metadata
- Tailor/user attribution
- Chronological ordering

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Submit progress via tailor interface** (`/order-progress/[token]`)

   - Upload photos for specific products
   - Add quality notes and challenges
   - Submit per-product progress

2. **View enhanced history** (`/dashboard/orders-management/[id]`)

   - See detailed timeline with photos
   - View per-product completion details
   - Check photo gallery functionality

3. **Verify data storage**
   - Check `ProductProgressReport` entries
   - Verify `ProductProgressPhoto` records
   - Confirm file storage in `/uploads/progress-photos/`

## Benefits

1. **Better tracking**: Per-product progress instead of just order-level
2. **Rich media**: Proper photo storage and display
3. **Enhanced UX**: Visual timeline with detailed information
4. **Data integrity**: Proper relational structure
5. **Scalability**: Supports multiple products per order
6. **Backward compatibility**: Works with existing legacy data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Image processing**: Add thumbnail generation
2. **Photo compression**: Optimize file sizes
3. **Cloud storage**: Move to AWS S3 or similar
4. **Real-time updates**: WebSocket notifications
5. **Photo annotations**: Allow marking up images
6. **Export functionality**: Generate progress reports as PDFs
