# Product Stock Management System

## Overview

This system provides comprehensive product stock management capabilities with automatic stock updates when orders are completed, manual stock adjustments, and stock movement tracking.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Stock Updates

**When Orders are Completed:**

- Product stock (`qtyOnHand`) is automatically increased when an order status changes to "COMPLETED"
- Stock is increased by the `completedQty` of each product in the order
- Stock movements are tracked in the material movements table with detailed notes
- Users receive notifications about stock updates when changing order status

**Backend Implementation:**

- `updateOrderStatus` in `ordersManagementController.js` automatically updates product stock
- Uses database transactions to ensure data consistency
- Creates movement records for audit trail

### 2. Manual Stock Management

**Product Stock Controller** (`productStockController.js`):

- `adjustProductStock`: Add/subtract stock with reasons (IN/OUT/ADJUST operations)
- `setProductStock`: Set stock to a specific level
- `getProductStockMovements`: View stock movement history
- `completeOrderStock`: Manually update stock for completed orders
- `bulkCompleteOrdersStock`: Bulk update stock for multiple completed orders

**API Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/products/stock/complete-order` - Update stock for single completed order
- `POST /api/products/stock/bulk-complete` - Bulk update stock for multiple orders
- `POST /api/products/:id/stock/adjust` - Manual stock adjustment
- `PUT /api/products/:id/stock/set` - Set stock level
- `GET /api/products/:id/stock/movements` - Get movement history

### 3. Frontend Stock Management

**Product Stock Management Page** (`/dashboard/products/[id]/stock`):

- View current stock levels with visual indicators (In Stock/Low Stock/Out of Stock)
- Manual stock adjustment form with reason tracking
- Set stock level functionality
- Complete stock movement history with pagination
- Admin-only access protection

**Integration with Existing Pages:**

- Added "Manage Stock" buttons to product list and detail pages (admin only)
- Enhanced products page with cache-busting for real-time stock data
- Automatic stock update notifications in order management

### 4. Bulk Operations

**Orders Management Page**:

- "Update Stock from Completed Orders" button for bulk stock updates
- Automatically processes all completed orders and updates product stock
- Provides detailed feedback on processed orders and stock updates

### Stock Movement Tracking

All stock changes are tracked with:

- Date and time of change
- Type of movement (IN/OUT/ADJUST)
- Quantity changed
- Stock level after change
- Detailed notes explaining the change
- User who made the change
- Related order (if applicable)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The system uses the existing `MaterialMovement` table to track product stock movements with special notes to identify product-related movements.

### Cache Management

- Product cache is cleared when stock is updated
- Products page uses cache-busting parameters for real-time data
- Manual refresh functionality ensures latest stock levels

### Error Handling

- Validation for stock adjustments (can't go below 0 for OUT operations)
- Transaction-based updates for data consistency
- Comprehensive error messages and user feedback
- Graceful fallbacks if stock update fails

### Security

- Admin-only access to stock management features
- User authentication required for all stock operations
- Audit trail for all stock changes with user tracking
